# Omni Crypto Dex Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality
All code must be clean, maintainable, and well-documented. This includes adhering to established coding standards, using meaningful names for variables and functions, and keeping functions short and focused.

### II. Comprehensive Testing
Every new feature must be accompanied by a comprehensive suite of tests, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests where applicable. All tests must be run and pass after every change to the codebase before merging to the main branch.

### III. Consistent User Experience
The user experience must be consistent and intuitive across the entire application. This includes adhering to a design system, using consistent terminology, and ensuring predictable user flows.

### IV. Performance Requirements
The application must meet or exceed defined performance benchmarks. This includes response times, resource utilization, and scalability under load. Performance testing should be a regular part of the development cycle.

## Governance
This constitution is the single source of truth for project development standards. All development activities must adhere to the principles outlined herein. Amendments to this constitution require team consensus and must be documented.
