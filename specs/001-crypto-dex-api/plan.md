# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11
**Primary Dependencies**: Flask
**Storage**: SQLite
**Testing**: pytest
**Target Platform**: Linux server
**Project Type**: Web application (backend)
**Performance Goals**: <500ms for price quotes, <1s for trade execution, 100 concurrent requests
**Constraints**: 99.9% uptime
**Scale/Scope**: Support for Hyperliquid, Lighter, and Drift protocols

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Code Quality**: The design will use abstract classes for DEX integrations to ensure maintainability.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: A full test suite using pytest will be developed, including unit and integration tests for each DEX.
- **Consistent User Experience**: N/A (API only)
- **Performance Requirements**: The performance goals from the spec are explicitly listed above.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Code Quality**: Does the proposed solution adhere to clean code principles?
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Is there a clear testing strategy for the feature?
- **Consistent User Experience**: Does the design align with the existing UX patterns?
- **Performance Requirements**: Are the performance implications of the feature understood and acceptable?

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
